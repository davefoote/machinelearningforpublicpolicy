HW5 - Dave Foote

the Walk Through Jupyter Notebook shows all of the stuff you guys asked for that doesn't necessarily come up in the prompt for the write up.

model_analyzer.py contains the code that calculates my metrics and prints my graphs

ml_loop.py contains the functions necessary to implement the pipeline, which I can't tell if it needs to be a script or if I can just show the pipeline working in the walk through.
